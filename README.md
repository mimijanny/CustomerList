# CustomerList
This Dataset is from a car production company and these are the details of their previous customers.
This company wants to analyze the dataset and build a machine learning model so they can target
their future customers accordingly. The company is only interested to predict that a customer will purchase
a car or not, this means that the company wants a binary option. From the statement above, this is a CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM. Here I'm going to analyze the dataset with some classification machine learning model, and I will test the accuracy of the model applied on the dataset and compare all the models to find out which one is the best model for the dataset.
